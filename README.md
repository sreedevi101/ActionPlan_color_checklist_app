 ## Development version 3 - Dynamically change theme on user selection
 
 In Settings, there is an option to change the theme of the app. User can select one of the themes from a DialogFragment window that has a recycler view with the available Themes. On selecting a theme, a sample of the theme is displayed on the dialog fragment window by changing the various views like a sample status bar, tool bar and a margin to the colors of the theme.
